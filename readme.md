This repository provides a showcase for [monadyssey](https://github.com/gabriel-bornea/monadyssey) - a toolkit 
designed to enhance application robustness with functional programming. It demonstrates how `monadyssey` can be
effectively used to structure and manage your code functionally. The examples cover real-world scenarios, 
showcasing how data types like `IO` or `Schedule` help tackle complexity, manage side-effects, and result in more 
reliable, readable, and clean code.
